# IoT and Data Analytics
This repository contains all the programming work done by Ian Feekes (ianfeekes@gmail.com) for the University of San Diego MS. Applied Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning program's IoT and Data Analytics course.

## Assignment 2: EDA and Cleaning
The first assignment involved EDA & cleaning for the household power consumption dataset https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption#

## Assignment 3: Linear Regression
The second assignment performed linear regression on the household power consumption dataset to illustrate edge computing use cases seen in IoT.

## Assignment 4: LSTM
The fourth assignment examined running RNN and LSTM models on the household power consumption dataset with hyperparameter tuning.

## Final Assignment
The final assignment examines smart wearable data and performs edge computing ML algorithms for calorie prediction and creates deep learning time-series models for exercise classification.
